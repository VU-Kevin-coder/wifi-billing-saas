Architecture direction: Keep existing routers on the site-agent path by default; make RADIUS an explicit per-router opt-in. Preserve SITE_AGENT_REQUIRED, current APIs and access terms, and distinguish payment completion from access activation.

No dedicated Flutterwave charge-webhook feature test was found. If Phase 1 changes that handler, explicitly test verified success, mismatch/unavailable verification, and replay behavior.
